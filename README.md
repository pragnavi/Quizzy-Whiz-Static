## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

Building Quizzy Whiz presented a few key challenges, particularly in ensuring UI responsiveness across various devices, managing the trivia data effectively, and creating an intuitive user interaction flow. Addressing UI responsiveness involved leveraging AutoLayout and Stack Views for a flexible layout. For data management, structured data models and enums were used to organize trivia content efficiently. Enhancing user interaction required implementing logic to handle answer selection and feedback dynamically. Overcoming these challenges was crucial to delivering a seamless and engaging trivia experience in Quizzy Whiz.
